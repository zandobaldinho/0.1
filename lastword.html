                  A troubled mind makes you want to live in your own world, isolated from other people, 
                  cultures, animals, rituals, customs, clothes, and opinions.<br><br>

                  If you are able to create your own world — and you are, everyone has the gift of creativity — 
                  this space becomes your point of peace, a place for rest and reflection, almost a fortress of solitude, 
                  but also a prison. Where, if you dive too deep, you will drift away from the social customs that help you 
                  remain accepted in society.<br><br>

                  But, to be honest, who said I want to live in a society? Especially one where I, on my own, 
                  am not accepted? When I speak my mind, they ask me who I think I am. The real question is: who are you? I know who I am; I don’t who are you.

                      Now we reach an interesting point, where you, who once viewed society as something that didn’t understand 
                      your way of acting or thinking, encounter someone who tries to understand you. Though they may not fully grasp who you are, 
                      this person doesn’t treat you as something entirely abnormal, like an event, as if everything you do is completely out of the 
                      ordinary and needs to be judged.<br><br>

                      This person doesn’t judge you; they show a genuine interest in a healthy way, 
                      without overstepping, which feels refreshing. It makes you want to engage with them, 
                      as it’s rare for someone to treat you this way. <br><br>

                      The key point of this seemingly casual encounter is: is this person accepted by society? YES! 
                      This brings a sense of duality, making you question how someone from the same group as those 
                      who judge you can treat you so differently. It shows you why we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, 
                      helping you understand why God gives everyone a chance, even when we don’t fully understand it.<br><br>

                      Even if someone doesn’t appear to be what you expect them to be, they could, in fact, be exactly what you least expect. 
                      Though we try to see life as one big picture, or to perceive it as a whole, we don’t have the ability to see it completely.<br><br>
                      So, this person brings a complete shift in your perspective on life—on how to see it, live it, and be it. They become your life.
