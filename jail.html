            <p class="text-monospace">The image presents a dim, oppressive cell, 
                surrounded by black iron bars that emit a sense of confinement and restraint. 
                The darkness of the cell is thick, marked by shades of black and gray, creating 
                an enclosed and impenetrable environment. The robust and imposing iron bars reinforce 
                the idea of a secure and inescapable space. However, at the heart of this prison of 
                shadows, something unexpected catches the eye: a vulture, not in the gloomy tone one 
                might expect, but in an explosion of vibrant colors. Its feathers, tinted in blue, green, 
                red, and yellow, contrast almost surrealistically with the surrounding darkness. The clash 
                between light and shadow, freedom and captivity, creates an enigmatic atmosphere filled 
                with unanswered questions, as though something is about to be revealed, but still remains just out of reach.</p>
